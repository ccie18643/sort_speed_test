# Sort speed test
Goal of this project is to implement bubble, selection, insertion, merge and quick sort algorithms using Python, Rust, C and Assembly languages to compare the performance of each implementation. Implementations are supposed to take advantage of every available feature of each language that may speed up code execution.
